## Project Proposal

### **Synopsis**
This project aims to enhance the Movement library by integrating an optimized multi-object tracking system that ensures accurate position, velocity, and acceleration smoothing while effectively handling identity switches in Multi-Animal Tracking.

At its core, the system will utilize an advanced **Kalman Filter framework**, rigorously benchmarked to select the most efficient configuration for the Movement dataset. The implementation will incorporate state-of-the-art identity association techniques, including:

- **Mahalanobis Distance & Hungarian Algorithm** for optimal detection-to-track assignment, minimizing incorrect identity associations.
- **Joint Probabilistic Data Association (JPDA)** to enhance stability in complex scenarios, where multiple animals interact or occlusions occur.
- **Re-Identification (Re-ID) with Deep Learning** to extract deep feature embeddings from animal appearances, ensuring long-term identity tracking.

To further improve decision-making, the tracking pipeline will compute a **dynamic confidence score** for each frame, integrating:
- **Motion Consistency Score**, derived from Kalman Filter-based trajectory predictions.
- **Appearance Similarity Score**, leveraging deep CNN feature embeddings for Re-ID.
- **Final Fusion Score**, a weighted combination of motion and appearance cues for robust identity resolution.

By the project's completion, the **Movement library** will feature a highly accurate, AI-powered multi-animal tracking pipeline capable of handling occlusions, identity switches, and non-linear motion.
